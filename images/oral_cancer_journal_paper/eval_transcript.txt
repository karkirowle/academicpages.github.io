36_1	I INITIALLY DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY INTENTIONS OF SHARING THAT STUFF IN FACT MOST OF THOSE FOLLOWS I HADN'T EVEN SEEN
36_2	THERE WERE JUST NUMEROUS PEOPLE EVEN MY AGE OR YOUNGER OF THAT HAD BEEN POSTING THAT DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS
36_3	RIGHT THAT YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO CHANGE THAT BUT YOU CAN SERVE YOUR MILITARY INVOLVED
36_4	AT EIGHTTEEN THERE COULD BE NOT ANY FURTHER OFF THAN THAT
36_5	FINALLY I WENT TO A DENTIST AND IT WAS THAT'S WHAT IT WAS AND THEN IT PROGRESSED REALLY QUICKLY FROM THERE AND I WAS LIKE TOTALLY
36_6	BUT THEN IT'S KIND OF WHAT IT TOOK FOR ME TO STOP
36_7	BUT I KNOW WHEN I SAW THEM I WOULD JUST WALK AWAY BECAUSE IT WAS SO UNCOMFORTABLE
36_8	IS IT AN ENTIRE FAMILY THAT HAS TO PAY FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT
36_9	BUT HOPEFULLY BY THEN IT WON'T EVEN BE AS COMMON HOPEFULLY IT WILL STOP BEING PUSHED AND ADVERTISED AT ALL
35_01	ALTHOUGH IF I AM IN THE BACK THEY DON'T HEAR ME BUT I'M STILL SINGING
35_02	SOME OF MY THIGH MUSCLE TO RECONSTRUCT MY TONGUE
35_03	BECAUSE I KNOW FOR FACT THAT YOU CAN BUILD YOUR MUSCLES BACK UP
35_04	NOT BEING ABLE TO WALK WAS ONLY TEMPORARY
35_05	AND WITHIN ELEVEN WEEKS I WAS WALKING ON MY OWN
35_06	SO YES I HAVE A GREAT BIG SCAR ON MY THIGH
35_07	AND I HAVE A NEW RECONSTRUCTED TONGUE THAT IS BEAUTIFUL
35_08	HAVING A RECONSTRUCTED TONGUE IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO MOVE YOUR TONGUE AROUND
35_09	LOOK AT ME I HAVE NO TONGUE
35_10	I AM EATING I AM DRINKING I AM DOING GREAT
34_1	THIS IS A RATHER LARGE UNEXPECTED CHANGE
34_2	AND THEN IT CHANGES YOUR OUTLOOK FROM THERE ON
34_3	SO KIND OF PSYICHOLOGICALLY EMOTIONALLY PERSONALLY I AM NOT SURE YOU CAN GET BACK TO WHAT WAS NORMAL
34_4	BUT PRETTY SOON YOU KIND OF FEEL LIKE THIS IS WHO I AM NOW AND YOU BECOME OKAY WITH THAT
34_5	I STILL HAVE PLENTY OF REHAB TO DO AFTER SURGERY
34_6	AND TO HAVE PARENTS YOU KNOW WHO DO CARE AND WHO WOULD BE THERE FOR ME YOU KNOW
34_7	YOU KNOW THEY TAKE YOUR WEIGHT AND YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE AND YOUR TEMPERATURE EVERY TIME YOU COME IN TO THE HOSPITAL RIGHT
34_8	MY BLOOD PRESSURE IS ROUTINELY LIKE THIRTY POINTS HIGHER EVERY TIME BEFORE AN ONCOLOGY APPOINTMENT THEN IT IS WHEN I SEE A REGULAR DOCTOR
34_9	YOU KNOW BUT LUCKILY THAT IT DIDN'T COME BACK IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS NOW
34_10	THERE IS REALLY NO GOOD TIME TO GET A DIAGNOSIS LIKE THIS
33_1	I WAS GETTING PRETTY GROUCHY WITH EVERYONE EVERY TIME THAT LITTLE GIRL WOULD HIT ME TEETH
33_2	I COULDN'T TAKE I WAS JUST ALWAYS IN A BAD MOOD
33_3	THE PAIN THAT I HAD WAS UNBEARABLE
33_4	SO WHEN THEY SAY CANCER HURTS IT HURTS
33_5	THERE IS A FIFTY SOMETHING PERCENT THAT I WOULD DIE
33_6	BUT IF I TAKE CARE OF IT THEN IT GOES UP INTO YOUR HIGH NINETIES
33_7	I HAD THE CHOICE TO GO TO A DIFFERENT HOSPITAL
33_8	BUT SOMETHING JUST DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT BUT WHEN DOCTOR MARCO JUST STARTED TALKING TO ME HE MADE ME SO COMFORTABLE
33_9	SO YEAH HE HE GOT ME REALLY CALM AND I WAS READY FOR ALL THIS
33_10	NOW I STOP AND LISTEN TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE ACTUALLY GONE THROUGH STUFF
32_1	I'M CHRISTINE AND I USED TO SMOKE
32_2	MY TIP IS WHEN YOU HEAR THE WORDS ORAL CANCER
32_3	THINK ABOUT MORE THAN JUST YOUR MOUTH
32_4	THE SKIN GRAFTS AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
32_5	CAN REALLY LEAVE A MARK ON YOUR ARM YOUR SHOULDER AND YOUR NECK
32_6	NOT TO MENTION WHAT IT COULD DO TO YOUR FACE
014_1	LUCKILY I WAS DIAGNOSED AND I WAS STARTING TREATMENT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY
014_2	THE CHEMOTHERAPY WAS PRETTY GOOD WE COME A LONG WAY NOW SO PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT IT THEY SHOULDN'T
014_3	I MEAN THEY HAVE DRUGS NOW THEY DON'T EVEN GET NAUSEAOUS
014_4	THE TUMORS ARE COMPLETELY GONE THE TUMOUR CAN'T FIND THEM SO I AM HAPPY
id010_1	THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS TONGUE CANCER
id010_2	ALMOST LIKE I HAD BIT MY TONGUE BUT IT DIDN'T GO AWAY
id010_3	IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE AFTER THE PROCEDURE IT WAS A LOT MORE INTENSE THAN I EXPECTED
id010_3	YOU KIND OF KNOW YOUR BODY AND YOU KNOW WHEN THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON
001_1	IT IS APRIL SEVENTEENTH FIVE DAYS AFTER MY TONGUE SURGERY
001_2	I AM AT HOME I CAME HOME YESTERDAY 
001_3	THEY HAVE REMOVED THEM ALL FROM ME I USED TO HAVE A DRAIN HERE THAT DRAINS BLOOD BUT THEY TOOK THAT OUT YESTERDAY
001_4	SWALLOWING HURTS AND I HAVE TO STAY ON TOP OF MY PAIN MEDICATION OTHERWISE IT IS VERY DIFFICULT AND
001_5	I'M SO HAPPY THAT I DO NOT HAVE CANCER IN MY LYMPH NODES
003_1	I AM STARTING TO EAT SOLID FOODS I CAN CHEW ON MY RIGHT SIDE AND I CAN OPEN MY TONGUE
003_2	BUT ALL IN ALL I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S COMING ALONG QUITE WELL
003_3	I AM LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT GOING BACK TO WORK I AM STILL TAKING MY PAIN MEDS BUT I AM SPACING THEM OUT
003_4	I WILL BE ABLE TO SPEAK A LOT WITHOUT BECOMING EXHAUSTED SO IT IS AMAZING HOW THE SURGERY HAS MADE ME SO TIRED
003_5	JUST DRIVING ON THE ROAD AND REALISING THAT I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT CANCER I STARTED CRYING
018_1	MY DENTISTS AT THAT TIME NOTICED THAT I HAD A DARK SPOT ON THE PANORAMIC THAT WAS BELOW THE GUM LINES THAT SHE REALLY COULDN'T IDENTIFY
018_2	SHE TOOK ME BACK AND DID AN ADDITIONAL TWENTYFIVE X-RAYS FREE OF CHARGE
018_3	TOLD ME TAKE THESE TO THE ORAL SURGEON HELP LOCATE THE MASS AND SEE WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH 
018_4	AND WE LOOKED AND GOT A BETTER IMAGING AND AT THAT POINT YOU MUST REALIZE I WAS THIRTYFIVE YEAR OLD FEMALE
018_5	I HAD NO SIGN NO SYMPTOMS NO PAIN 
018_6	CLUES THAT WOULD LEAD YOU TO THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE THE CASE
018_7	GROWING INSIDE MY RIGHT MANDIBLE SLOWLY SEPARATING MY JAWS IT WAS EVENTUALLY GOING TO BREAK IT
018_8	SO AT THAT POINT WE TOOK A A WISDOM TOOTH DID A BIOPSY AND SENT IT OFF TO BE HAVE A BIOPSY
018_9	AND TWO WEEKS LATER THE RESULTS CAME IN WE ALL WENT MY HUSBAND AND I SCARED TO DEATH
018_10	WE JUST NEED TO SEND YOU DOWN TO MU SC AND YOU NEED TO HAVE IT REMOVED BECAUSE OF THE SIZE AND LOCATION IT'S JUST TOO LARGE FOR ME TO DO IN THE OFFICE
