Before Interspeech, we had a quick opportunity to showcase our results so far, and talk about data management
and research ethics.

Ethics is always a not so interesting topic unfortunately -- my impression was however, that there were three
recurring themes of the presentations', which might worth a quick read for somebody not willing to sit a series of
these presentation. The presentations are not online yet to do that, but meanwhile, you can catch up on the 
recordings of the previous event [here](https://portal.klewel.com/watch/webcast/tapas-training-event-2-day1/)

So, I will summarise these here and add a few comments on some aspects of the training event.

## The regulatory view

GDPR is here and we do have to conform to it. Fortunately, my impression was that as a
researcher we rarely have to handle the regulatory aspects on our own. For example, in the hospital I'm working these are given as
expectations, and incorporated to the ICT's working mechanisms. All we have to ensure is that we conform to some level of
common sense, inform the owners' of the data about how their data are processed and request consent.

## Competitive research vs. being able to live with our research

There are some countries which are attractive for researchers, because the ethical standards of the country are less sensitive to
certain issues. This enables faster development of research, due to lesser administrative burden. As a researcher, I am personally
frustrated with the administrative burden of these ethical considerations, and the total manhours we are spending on this. Still, at 
the end of the day I don't want my data to be mishandled, my DNA or blood type lying around in the internet.

## Even if it's legal, you should not neccessarily do it

There are certain practices which are entirely legal, but as a company or a researcher, you have a brand to manage. If your brand is
damaged by something that is legal, but unethical, or controversial, you are in a problematic situation. You will have potentially dropped
sales or less opportunities.

## If you are in Toulouse...

Make sure to try the vegetarian restaurant Le Faim des Haricots, we have eaten there two times during our short stay in Toulouse. I am personally
neither vegetarian nor vegan, but I enjoy vegetarian food, and this was a really good deal buffet restaurant. I really enjoyed the time in Toulouse,
though not all presentations were interesting, I had some really thought-provoking and inspiring conversations during the week.
