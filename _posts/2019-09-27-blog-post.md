I was lucky to attend not only the annual Interspeech conference in Graz, but also the 10th Speech Synthesis Workshop in Vienna.
Based on my experience, I would like to share the trends I observed, and the revelations I have from these two very different events.

## Tutorials

The week started with tutorials on Sunday, which was a great opportunity to revise and solidify my understanding of voice conversion and
adversarial security. I really liked how everything was done in Google Colaboratory during the first tutorial, which completely nullified the
installation overhead. Usually I found these overheads are the greatest timesinks, and this extra effort really shown use that frameworks like
sprocket are very easy to use.

## Resources

Following Interspeech, and the related Twitter hashtags, one could get access to many useful resources:

1. (End-to-end speech processing tutorial)[https://github.com/espnet/interspeech2019-tutorial]
2. (Voice conversion tutorial)[https://github.com/kan-bayashi/INTERSPEECH19_TUTORIAL]
3. (Keichii Tokuda keynote material)[https://www.techno-speech.com/]
4. (Ludwig dialogue AI from Uber)[https://t.co/ybyyAxQ4fG?amp=1]

## Sessions and trends

Attention, attention, WaveNet/Tacotron/WaveRNN -- these are inarguably were the greates trends during Interspeech and SSW10. 



## Some thoughts on waste

Twitter was really full on complaints for a more environmentally conscious conference -- organisers were (unjustly) criticised for the waste
generated by the conference. In all scenarios, I've observed that the organisers acted promptly and swiftly to these concerns, providing opportunity
to recycle the conferences badges and posters.
