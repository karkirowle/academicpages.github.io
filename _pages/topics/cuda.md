The ultimate Tensorflow install guide

I think there is something so interesting about how difficult it is to install Tensorflow, while
there is an impressive amount of effort being done to make it work, and make it easier. This guide is
not a comprehensive guide, but simply is made by myself out of pure interest. I try to point out some philosophical
things in this guide too, which is meant partly as a criticism of design decisions, common sources of errors.

1. The compatibility problem

There is no such thing as an official Tensowflow compatibility chart, or at least not something that is easy to do find with
my skills of Google, so it is probably going to cause some difficulties to laymen installing Tensorflow.
The closest I found is this one https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50622525/which-tensorflow-and-cuda-version-combinations-are-compatible
