This is a collection of links, that I've found useful or just interesting in the past.

Online courses
======
[MIT Linear Algebra Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8) - I've found this a very good revisit of Linear Algebra
course, especially the focus on interpretation of linear algebra with geometrical intuition and also the comparisons between normal and linear
algebra which makes it a lot easier to understand
[Reinforcement Learning Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7-jPKtc4r78-wCZcQn5IqyuWhBZ8fOxT) - Though, I still need to go through the majority of lectures, so far
I fond it's good introductory resource to Reinforcement Learning with an experienced teacher for free

Neural networks resources
======
[Karpathy's Stanford Course](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/) - Especially on the bit explaining the backpropagation algorithm I've found useful
[Overview of CNN layer](http://andrew.gibiansky.com/blog/machine-learning/convolutional-neural-networks/) - A good blog article about CNNs
[Durk Kingma's Thesis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v6ua3d9yt44vgb3/cover_and_thesis.pdf?dl=1) - All the greatest developments of the last decade in one single thesis.

Book(s)
======
[Bishop's Pattern Recognition Book](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwis54PO3crXAhWJJ8AKHU55CEYQFghZMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fusers.isr.ist.utl.pt%2F~wurmd%2FLivros%2Fschool%2FBishop%2520-%2520Pattern%2520Recognition%2520And%2520Machine%2520Learning%2520-%2520Springer%2520%25202006.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2j0fMGPbFfpcwGzqELtiRU) -
A good, comprehensive book on ML techniques which is a safe place to go back for background information
David Allen: Getting Things Done - one of the better productivity bibles
Durrett's Measure Theory book
Speech
======
