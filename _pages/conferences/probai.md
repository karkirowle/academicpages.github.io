## Brief intro

I attended a summer school about probabilistic machine learning in the
first week of July this year in 2019. Probabilistic machine learning (sometimes
Bayesian Machine Learning) is a discipline of machine learning where the
uncertainty of a decision is also calculated. This is really interesting
topic for many medical and other mission critical applied research now, as often a yes-or-no decision
is not enough.

## The venue

Trondheim is absoutely stunning, but not cheap. If you are looking for
some untouched nature or a retreat from your PhD life, I definitely
recommend it, but be wary - apart from nature there is not too much to see!
However, all the restaurants were top notch in Trondheim. I would definitely
recommend Max's Pizza if you are into greasy Domino's like Pizza.

## Lectures I liked the best

The two talks that I definitely adored the most were the one about
Importance Weighted Autoencoders and the one about Sparse Bayesian Neural
Networks. I have done by thesis about automatic relevance determination
and I think it's one of the most appealing way to Bayesian for people
who are looking for a principled framework on dealing with prior probability
distributions.

## What I've learned

I think it was a great practical look at Bayesian Machine Learning and
Probabilistic Graphical models. It was refreshing to have a great review
of the past fews machine learning literature, and I got confirmed that
cycle consistent GANs are indeed becoming more than a niche ML research
area.

The related coursework as one of the most rewarding assignments I have
ever done, because it really helps to bring together the theory and practice
in your mind.

Depending on next year's topics I might consider attending again, but it
was definitely a refreshing experience.
