## Brief intro

I attended a [summer school](https://probabilistic.ai/) about probabilistic machine learning in the
first week of June this year in 2019. Probabilistic machine learning (sometimes
Bayesian Machine Learning) is a discipline of machine learning where the
uncertainty of a decision is also calculated. This is really interesting
topic for many medical and other mission critical applied research now, as often a yes-or-no decision
is not enough.

## The venue

Trondheim is absoutely stunning, but not cheap. If you are looking for
some untouched nature or a retreat from your PhD life, I definitely
recommend it, but be wary - apart from nature there is not too much to see!
However, all the restaurants were top notch in Trondheim. I would definitely
recommend [Peppes Pizza](https://www.peppes.no/desktop/s/frontpage/?0&utm_source=google+my+business&utm_medium=organic&utm_content=trondheim)if you are into greasy Domino's like Pizza.

## Lectures I liked the most

The two talks that I definitely adored the most were the one about
Importance Weighted Autoencoders and the one about Sparse Bayesian Neural
Networks. I have done my Master's thesis about automatic relevance determination,
and I think it's one of the most appealing way to do Bayesian for people,
who are looking for a principled framework, dealing with prior probability
distributions.

## What I've learned


I think it was a great practical look at Bayesian Machine Learning and
Probabilistic Graphical models. It was refreshing to have a great review
of the past few years machine learning literature, and I got confirmed that
cycle-consistent GANs (and GANS in general) are indeed becoming more than a niche ML research
area.

The related coursework was one of the most rewarding assignments I have
ever done, because it really helped me bring together the theory and practice
in my mind.

Depending on next year's topics I might consider attending again, but it
was definitely a refreshing breakout from my PhD life.
