If you are already familiar with variational autoencoders, and if you
are fascinated by the results of variational inference, then importance
weighted autoencoders (IWAE) might just go one step higher - by rethinking
what the evidence lower bound really is.


Variational autoencoder view
======

While many of us use variational autoencoders, not all of use are clear
on the basic concepts of the Variational Bayes method, so it is worth
revisiting the optimisation of the variational autoencoder from that
perspective.

The problem of autoencoders mathematically is learning an encoder and decoder
which compresses $ x $ into a latent representation $ z $.
