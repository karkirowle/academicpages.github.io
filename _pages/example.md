Intuition:
In constructing a probability space, we have to make sure of two things: does our sigma algebra work under the operations we normally
use with probability events? If it does, is the probability measure prescribed non-pathological, in the sense, that if we have measure
two bricks together or separately, do they add up to the same number?


In this exercise, we have to check so that $ ( \Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P} ) $ is a probability space.

Sigma algebra

1. The sigma algebra for any given set should contain its complement, and its union.

2. 
$ x^2 $
